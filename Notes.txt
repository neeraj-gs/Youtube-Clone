Thigs to know in a frontend Framework
    1.FLex 
    2.Grids
    3.Responsiveness
    4.Bg color,text,color,hover


FLex
    It is used to make somethign flow 
    Removes blockline behaviour of it 
    justify-content:
    flex-start
    flex-end
    center
    space-between
    space-around

This is how we do in Raw HTML 

    To do this in Tailwind CSS 
        We will add styles to the class-Name itself and make it better 
        We add all the styles inside of html eelelmet inside teh className after importning TCSS 

        Names are also slighttly changed 
        justify-end 
        justify-start 
        justify-between ... 


GRIDS  IN TW 
    Another way instead of Flex to arrangs block to inline 
    grid grid-cols-3
        3 eleemtns are added onto the webapge equally spaced 
    
    To amke Grids with diffrent widrhs
        If extra spavce it will be emoty 

            For unequal Widths to split window into 12 parts
                We specify there are 12 children    grid-cols-12
                Fir each element 
                col-span-x //takes x sapces and works on it 



Responsiveness in Tailwind CSS 
    To cahgne the grid cols based on Resppnsiveness
    TCSS provides breakpoints 
        sm -- < 640px
        md 
        lg
        xl
        2xl
    For diffrent screen sizes we have diffrent breakooints

    TO Make a Responsiveness
        TCSS we need to use first for mobile devices and then add it to larger screens on the go 
            To conditionally specify styles in css 
                class='sm:text-center'
        Below sm Default exitsa and anyhting above froma  braeakpositnteh styles come it
            SO we need to add at each style and do it
        So after a Breakpoint till 2xl it takes the style , before hat efault
